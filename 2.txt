<p>The crazy days, the city lights </p>
<p> The way you'd play with me like a child </p>
<p>Will you still love me when I'm no longer yound and beautiful </p>
<p>Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul </p>
<p>I know you will, I know you will </p>
<p>I know that you will </p>
<p>Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful </p>
<p>I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now </p>
<p>Channeling angels in the new age now</p>
<p>Hot summer days, rock and roll </p>
<p>The way you'd play for me at your show </p>
<p>And all the ways I got to know</p>
<p>Your pretty face and electric soul </p>
